# IAV-GUI
Welcome to Integrated Autonomous Vehicle (IAV) Capstone GUI component. This is a custom made UI/UX that attends to the needs and capabilities of this project.

To use, please ensure that QT 5.9.7 is being used. 
      You can download it from https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.9/5.9.7/
      
 Updates soon to come about how to use the GUI, how to add version control on QT, and how to use Git on Windows or Linux
